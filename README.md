Cincinnati’s Tract 256: Evolution 2020 and Beyond

## Background
For decades, Cincinnati's population trends reflected a familiar story of Midwestern urban decline. However, the 2020 Census revealed a surprising shift: for the first time in 70 years, the population within Cincinnati proper grew, increasing from 296,943 to 309,317. As someone with a background in urban geography and regional government—and currently serving as immediate Past-President of the Kentucky Association of Mapping Professionals—this unexpected growth sparked my curiosity. What factors drove this change, and what lessons can other cities learn?

My project focuses on Census Tract 265, which emerged as a remarkable success story in urban revitalization. I aim to analyze the redevelopment patterns and planning decisions that contributed to its growth and explore how they could serve as a model for similar regions.

Upon analyzing the data, I noticed 4 census tracts really drove Cincinnati's growth. Tract 265, Tract 33, Tract 25, and Tract 30 all showed population increases of more than 1,000 people between the 2010 and 2020 censuses.  Tracts 33, 25, and 30 are all in close proximity or contained by the University of Cincinnati, so I found that trend less compelling.  Tract 265 however, may be one of the great success stories in modern American urban planning.

Cincinnati was blasted for years for killing it's riverfront and downtown by constructing massive freeway interchanges and 3 riverfront stadiums on them.  One merely has to do a quick google search to find an article like the 2009 article in the new york times, "Stadium Boom Deepens Municipal Woes" or observe a jpeg similar to the one above to understand this critique.  When I started examining Tract 265, the rebound was truly breathtaking.  As my developments geojson is already starting to show, there has been a healthy mixture new developments, and renovations of buildings.  This redevelopment has introduced a variety of new condos, apartments, restaurants, and attractions, revitalizing the tract and contributing to its population growth.  Enjoy viewing this project with me and don't hesitate to provide feedback.
